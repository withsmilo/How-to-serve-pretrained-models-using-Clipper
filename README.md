# How to serve pretrained models using Clipper

Clipper(http://clipper.ai) is a low-latency prediction serving system for machine learning. Clipper makes it simple to integrate machine learning into user-facing serving systems. I have written these Jupyter notebooks to guide you to make it easier to deploy a machine learning model pre-trained by the following popular frameworks.

* [Keras](https://github.com/withsmilo/How-to-serve-pretrained-models-using-Clipper/blob/master/sample/keras_on_docker_example.ipynb)
* [PyTorch](https://github.com/withsmilo/How-to-serve-pretrained-models-using-Clipper/blob/master/sample/pytorch_on_docker_example.ipynb)
* Tensorflow : will be added later.
